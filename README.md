## What is Standalone Chatbox?
● Standalone Chatbox is a python script inspired by MagicChatbox (yes I stole the name) but for standalone vr headsets or other devices.

## Why does this exist?
● I remembered that MagicChatbox existed and wanted something similar, but I didnt have a good enough laptop, so I just made my own.

## Do you plan to keep updating this?
● Depends on how bored I am

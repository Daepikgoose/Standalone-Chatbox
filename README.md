Standalone Chatbox is a python script made to create custom chatboxes similar to MagicChatbox but for non-pc players.
It's recommended to run Standalone Chatbox on a device other than the one running vrchat so that your system doesn't kill the process

## Changelog
+ added tag currentos (displays the operating system the script is ran on)
~ Renamed tag randomfact to randommessage
- made it so adding "--quick-start" after running the script (so "python StandaloneChatbox.py --quick-start") automaticly starts the script and skips the menu

## Features
- custom update rate
- animated messages
- saving your changes

## Tags
- {hour} the current hour
- {minute} the current minute
- {updaterate} delay between updates
- {randommessage} random message from a list, must be edited via the script
- {animatedmessage} the animated message
- {currentos} the os the script is ran on
